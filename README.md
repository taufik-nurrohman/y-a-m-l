PHP YAML Parser
===============

Motivation
----------

People donâ€™t seem to be looking for content management systems anymore. There are so many blogging services already that
allow them to just write. Personalization and monetization donâ€™t seem to be the main concerns anymore in this era of big
data. Or, if monetization is their only concern, they will tend to leave it up to the services they use, limiting their
ability to choose a web design that fits their personality.

This project is actually an internal feature of my content management system, [Mecha](https://github.com/mecha-cms), but
I decided to make it a stand-alone project now so that other people can use it too. People seem to have a tendency to
look for PHP YAML parsers, far more than their tendency to look for content management systems. So, this project is also
my attempt to drive people who need a PHP YAML parser to my content management system project that Iâ€™m proud of (which
is apparently not very popular since people seem to be more interested in static site generators these days).

Why should you choose my YAML parser over any other similar YAML parser out there?

 - [dallgoot/yaml](https://github.com/dallgoot/yaml) I havenâ€™t had time to check this parser yet.
 - [mustangostang/spyc](https://github.com/mustangostang/spyc) consists of one PHP file which is 35.1â€¯KB in size and
   contains a total of 1186 lines of code [since the time of writing][1]. It is out of date (only supports YAML 1.0 and
   is buggy [in][2] [various][3] [cases][4]) and is still comparatively bigger than my YAML parser.
 - [symfony/yaml](https://github.com/symfony/yaml) prioritizes reliability and stability for use in large-scale
   applications. This library contains a lot of dependencies that will make your application overly bloated if your main
   goal is simply to convert YAML syntax to PHP data.
 - [yaml](https://www.php.net/book.yaml) requires that your server allows you to install the PHP extension. In terms
   of conversion speed, it should be faster because it uses [C](https://pyyaml.org/wiki/LibYAML), but itâ€™s not
   guaranteed to be available on all PHP servers in the world that you can rent, considering that this PHP extension is
   not bundled with PHP by default.

Usage
-----

### Using Composer

From the command line interface, navigate to your project folder then run this command:

~~~ sh
composer require taufik-nurrohman/y-a-m-l
~~~

Require the generated auto-loader file in your application:

~~~ php
<?php

use function x\y_a_m_l\from as from_yaml;
use function x\y_a_m_l\to as to_yaml;

require 'vendor/autoload.php';

echo from_yaml('asdf: asdf'); // Returns `(object) ['asdf' => 'asdf']`
~~~

### Using File

Require the `from.php` and `to.php` files in your application:

~~~ php
<?php

use function x\y_a_m_l\from as from_yaml;
use function x\y_a_m_l\to as to_yaml;

require 'from.php';
require 'to.php';

echo from_yaml('asdf: asdf'); // Returns `(object) ['asdf' => 'asdf']`
~~~

Options
-------

~~~ php
/**
 * Convert YAML string to PHP data.
 *
 * @param null|string $value Your YAML string.
 * @param bool $array If this option is set to `true`, PHP object will becomes associative array.
 * @return mixed
 */
from(?string $value, bool $array = false, array &$lot = []): mixed;
~~~

~~~ php
/**
 * Convert PHP data to YAML string.
 *
 * @param mixed $value Your PHP data.
 * @param bool|int|string $dent Specify the indent size or character(s).
 * @return null|string
 */
to(mixed $value, bool|int|string $dent = true): ?string;
~~~

Tests
-----

Clone this repository into the root of your web server that supports PHP and then you can open the `test/from.php` and
`test/to.php` file with your browser to see the result and the performance of this converter in various cases.

Tweaks
------

Your YAML content is represented as variable `$value`. If you modify the content before the function `from_yaml()` is
called, it means that you modify the YAML content before it is converted. If you modify the content after the function
`from_yaml()` is called, it means that you modify the results of the YAML conversion.

### Document

This converter does not support multiple document feature in one YAML file, but can be supported with a little effort:

~~~ php
// Ensure line break after `---` and `...`
$value = preg_replace('/(^|\n)(-{3}|[.]{3})\s+/', '$1$2' . "\n", $value);

// Remove `---\n` prefix if any
if (0 === strpos($value, "---\n")) {
    $value = substr($value, 4);
}

$values = [];
foreach (explode("\n---\n", $value . "\n") as $v) {
    // Remove everything after `...`
    [$v, $else] = explode("\n...\n", "\n" . $v . "\n", 2);
    $values[] = from_yaml(substr($v, 1));
}

var_dump($values);
~~~

### Variable

There are several ways to declare variables in YAML, and all of them are not standard. The most common are variables
with a format like `{{ var }}`. To add a variable feature, you need to convert the variable to a YAML value before
parsing the data:

~~~ php
$variables = [
    'var_1' => 'asdf',
    'var_2' => true,
    'var_3' => 1,
    'var_4' => 1.5
];

if (false !== strpos($value, '{{')) {
    $value = preg_replace_callback('/"\{\{\s*[a-z]\w*\s*\}\}"|\'\{\{\s*[a-z]\w*\s*\}\}\'|\{\{\s*[a-z]\w*\s*\}\}/', static function ($m) use ($variables) {
        $variable = $m[0];
        // `"{{ var }}"`
        if ('"' === $variable[0] && '"' === substr($variable, -1)) {
            $variable = substr($variable, 1, -1);
        }
        // `'{{ var }}'`
        if ("'" === $variable[0] && "'" === substr($variable, -1)) {
            $variable = substr($variable, 1, -1);
        }
        // Trim variable from `{{` and `}}`
        $variable = trim(substr($variable, 2, -2));
        // Get the variable value if available, otherwise default to `null`
        $variable = $variables[$variable] ?? null;
        // Return the variable value as YAML string
        return to_yaml($variable);
    }, $value);
}

$value = from_yaml($value);

var_dump($value);
